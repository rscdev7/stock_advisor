    "Seasonal ARIMA (Autoregressive-Integrated-Moving Average) is a statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data and more in generale Stochastic Processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model is a composition of two further ones:\n",
    "1. Autoregressive Model \n",
    "2. Moving Average Model \n",
    "\n",
    "**Autoregressive Model (AR)** is a linear model that describes the outcome of a Stochastic Process as a linear combination of its own previous values and a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytic form of the AR model is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class='math'>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        F_{t} \\, = \\, \\text{AR}_{p}(t) \\,=\\, c + \\varepsilon_{t} + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\phi_{i} \\cdot X_{t-i} \n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above Formula shows the following cues:\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf{F_t}$ is the predicted value of time serie at time t given the last p values of time serie\n",
    "2. $\\mathbf{c}$, costant value\n",
    "3. $\\mathbf{\\phi_i}$, parameters of the model\n",
    "4. $\\mathbf{p}$, hyperparamiter that set the number of past observations in order to perform inference for the next step.\n",
    "For that, the model is usually referred as AR(p) where p is the aforementioned hyperparam\n",
    "5. $\\mathbf{\\varepsilon_t}$, white noise term that model the error\n",
    "6. $\\mathbf{X_t}$ is the actual value of time time at step t\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoregressive model can thus be viewed as the output of an *all-pole infinite impulse response filter* whose input is white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving Average Model (MA)** is the other sub-part of SARIMA Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moving-average model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on the current and various past values of a stochastic (imperfectly predictable) term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytic form of MA model is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class='math'>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        F_{t} \\, = \\, \\text{MA}_{q}(t) \\,=\\, \\mu + \\varepsilon_t  + \\sum_{i=1}^{q}\\theta_{i} \\cdot \\varepsilon_{t-i} \n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula shows the following features:\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf{F_t}$ is the predicted value of time serie at time t given the last q random shocks suffered by the system\n",
    "2. $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ is the mean of the time serie\n",
    "3. $\\mathbf{\\varepsilon_{t-i}}$ is the random shock (or error term) occured at time t-i\n",
    "4. $\\mathbf{\\theta_i}$ are the parameters of the Model\n",
    "5. $\\mathbf{q}$ is the hyperparameter of the model, it rules the number of past random shocks to employ for the inference of the next step of the time serie. For that, MA model is usually referred as MA(q) model.\n",
    "6. $\\mathbf{X_t}$ is the actual value of time time at step t\n",
    "\n",
    "Random shocks at each point are assumed to be mutually independent and to come from the same distribution, typically a normal distribution, with location at zero and constant scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a Signal Processing perspective, the moving-average model is a finite impulse response filter applied to white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal ARIMA** is a combination of these two models enriched with a *specific pre-processing* of data in order to ensure the *weak stationarity* of the Stochastic Process induced by the time serie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before explaining the pre-processing needed, we briefly report the definition of Weak Stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Stochastic Process $X$ is Weak Stationary if and only if:\n",
    "1. $\\mu(X_t) = \\mu(X_t+\\tau) \\quad \\forall \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $Cov_{X,X}\\,(t_1,t_2) = Cov_{X,X}\\,(t_1-t_2,0) \\quad \\forall t_1,t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $\\mathbb{E}\\,[|X_t|^{2}] < \\infty \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the definition is telling us that the mean of the time serie not vary respect the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Said that, it is worth saying that AR, MA models and ARMA (combination of AR and MA) are models designed for Weak Stationary Stochastic Process (a.k.a. Weak Stationary Time Series).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, real time series are not stationary, for this reason it would take a way to transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is the *Differencing* and corresponde to the letter \"I\" of the SARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differencing involves the following operation:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class='math'>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        z_t \\,=\\,\\nabla\\, X_t \\,=\\, X_t - X_{t-1}\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation ,essentialy, removes *Trends* from the time serie and enforce Weak Stationarity of hers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, is worth notice that data can require more steps of differencing in order to reach the weak stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, an ARMA model applied to the differenced data is usually referred as *ARIMA* model.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a Signalt Theory point of view, Differencing acts as high-pass filter to the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important issue of time series data is *Seasonality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, some specific behaviour of the Stochastic Process happpens at cyclic intervals of time (think at the grow of purchases in corrispondance of the Christmas Holidays).\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is called *Seasonality* and must be put in the accout in order to perform good forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we properly combine two ARIMA models (one for regular data and one for Seasonal Data extracted from the studied time serie) in the Seasonal ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has the following analytic expression:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class='math'>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, one can ask how to compute optimal SARIMA hyper params value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there is 3 ways:\n",
    "1. Plotting Autocorrelation (AFCF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) of the data and try to guess the right model with the help of some *common sense* rules.\n",
    "2. Optimizing a specific criterion respect to the hyperparamiters (ex. BIC, AIC etc..)\n",
    "3. Perform GridSearch on a restricted space of hyperparamiters"
